KNOWN BUGS:
- Title overflows box when viewport < 30 px
- Font is loading system font. This went unnoticed by me only because Droid sans also 
happens to be my default OS font in Arch Linux.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Background image is wasteful of data

 This project requires you to create a compelling page design and sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project: an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. Project emphasis will be on effortless, engaging entry of personal information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to hit on particular patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is you’re offering—not at all an easy task.
Goals

    Design and execute a progressively enhanced page focused on system users and tasks
    Write valid HTML5 and CSS, and error-free JavaScript
    Apply design principles including color/material and typography
    Prepare a touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive web design
    Engage in agile, iterative Web design and development, supported by version control
    Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience
